For fingerprinting, just go at your scheduled time, and it will be done quickly. For the interview, it’s best to arrive early, even as early as 7:30 AM, since the embassy will let you in regardless of your appointment time. Unlike in China, the Mexico City embassy has seating inside, so even if you wait for two and a half hours, you can remain seated. Bringing a book would be a good idea.</p><p>Visa Interview Process:</p><ol><li>First, wait in line. A staff member will check your information and mark &quot;TCN&quot; as yes or no on the barcode sticker on the back of your passport.</li><li>As you move forward in line, you’ll encounter a queue system similar to those in tourist attractions, where a staff member will collect the passports of those marked with &quot;TCN yes.&quot;</li><li>You’ll do fingerprinting again. The staff handling fingerprints are usually very friendly, and they might even wish you luck with your visa. Security check.</li><li>Continue forward, and a staff member will check your documents. Since you&#39;re marked as &quot;TCN yes,&quot; you will be directed to different seating from the locals to wait. Shortly after, a staff member will call your name with your passport in hand, and you&#39;ll get your passport back at this point.</li><li>The hardest part is now you can finally join the queue with the locals. However, regardless of which queue you&#39;re in, there are seats! Staff members will ask rows of people to stand and proceed to the interview, so you won’t need to stand in line the whole time!</li></ol><div class="hint-container important"><p class="hint-container-title">Important</p><p>Last time I went around 8 a.m., and I still waited for over 2 hours. So, make sure to go early!</p></div></li><li><h3 id="interview" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#interview"><span>Interview</span></a></h3><p>Many people likely have sensitive majors, and might require a security check that takes a month or even longer. In most cases, the interview officer will return your passport to you, allowing you to return to the U.S. under the <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/visa-information-resources/visa-expiration-date/auto-revalidate.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Auto Revalidation</a> policy. Technically, this policy doesn’t apply since you’ve reapplied for a visa, but many people have successfully returned to the U.S. via land (air travel is not recommended), so I won’t elaborate on this here.</p><p>Here are some tips for your reference:</p><ol><li><p><a href="https://xiao-zou.com/f1-%E5%B8%96%E5%AD%90/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xiao Zou&#39;s F1 post</a></p></li><li><p>Search <mark>鳕鱼爱葛阁</mark> on Wechat</p></li></ol></li></ul></div><h2 id="recommended-apps" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#recommended-apps"><span>Recommended Apps</span></a></h2><p><mark>Food Delivery</mark>: <strong>Uber Eats, Rappi, DiDi</strong>. <strong>Rappi</strong> is likely the most commonly used, but everything is in Spanish, so you may need to take screenshots and have <strong>ChatGPT</strong> translate them for you. <strong>Uber Eats</strong> is relatively more user-friendly.</p><p><mark>Ridesharing</mark>: <strong>Uber, DiDi</strong>. <strong>DiDi</strong> is often cheaper, and for longer trips, you can negotiate the price with the driver. <strong>Uber</strong> tends to be safer, but neither platform can fully guarantee your safety. Since you&#39;re already here, don&#39;t be too afraid.</p><h2 id="accommodation-recommendations" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#accommodation-recommendations"><span>Accommodation Recommendations</span></a></h2><p>I usually choose Airbnb near the embassy. The prices are relatively high but offer good value (definitely cheaper than hotels). The Airbnbs listed below are places I’ve stayed at — they’re safe and quiet. If you want something more upscale, you can stay at the Sheraton near the embassy. The embassy is right downstairs, and booking through Ctrip will likely be cheaper.</p><ol><li><p><a href="https://www.airbnb.cn/users/show/245618000" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alejandra&#39;s listing</a></p><p>The listings from this host are generally good, with prices typically ranging from 300 to 450 RMB per day <strong>(excluding cleaning fees and taxes)</strong>.</p><p><strong>Advantages</strong>:</p><ul><li><p>There is a dedicated team, and all listings are standardized.</p></li><li><p>You need a special access pass to enter, and the security guards will only let you in with it.
