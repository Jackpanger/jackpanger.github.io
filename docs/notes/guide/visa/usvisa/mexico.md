The chances of being checked in Mexico are lower, and there's a high probability that you can return to the U.S. and wait using Auto Revalidation, without delaying your regular work.

::: note

==Note the article's editing time in the top right corner, as policies may change.==

Mexico is usually suitable for **visa renewals** rather than **first-time** visa applications. This article mainly serves as a reference for students with an F1 visa who do not plan to return to their home country for renewal. For other cases, it is recommended to consult the relevant embassy documents.

## Entering Mexico

According to the [China Consular Service Website](http://cs.mfa.gov.cn/zggmcg/ljmdd/bmz_655327/mxg_657021/rjjl_657031/), a Mexican visa is not required only in the following cases:：

1. Permanent residency documents from Canada, the United States of America, Japan, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, any Schengen area country, or any member of the Pacific Alliance (Chile, Colombia, and Peru).

2. A valid visa from Canada, the United States of America, Japan, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, or any Schengen area country.

3. A Mexican APEC Business Traveler Card (ABTC).

4. Valid documentation for airplane crew members.

5. Crew members of international vessels arriving at Mexican ports must present a seaman's logbook. If the crew member arrives by plane to embark at a national port, they must present, in addition to the logbook, documentation related to the boarding, vessel details, and the port of location.

Note: Schengen area countries include Germany, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Slovenia, Slovakia, Spain, Estonia, Finland, France, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Norway, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, the Czech Republic, Sweden, and Switzerland.

   Please follow the instructions to complete the appointment booking. Note that 'United States' in Spanish is 'Estados Unidos'.

2. **Attend the visa interview.**

   Prepare the necessary documents and go directly to the interview. It should be on the 3rd floor, and there’s usually no need to wait in line. With the proper documents, it’s easy to pass. They will tell you it will take around 10 business days to receive it, but usually, it takes just about a week.

## U.S. Visa Application Process

:::: steps

- ### Fill out the DS-160 form online (U.S. Nonimmigrant Visa Electronic Application).

  The [DS160](https://ceac.state.gov/GenNIV/Default.aspx)form is required everywhere. However, for Mexico, you only need to upload a photo online, and there is no need to provide a physical photo in person.

- ### Log in to the visa appointment website, create an account, and complete your personal information.

  [Visa appointment website](https://ais.usvisa-info.com/en-mx/niv)。You need to select TCN (Third Country Nationals) here. The general recommendation is to select 'yes.' Some embassies may not check if you are a local resident, but if they do, there’s a high chance you won’t be allowed entry.

- ### The appointment website will email you the payment slip, which will include the fees of your new visa and the payment methods.

  Visa payment is different from other embassies; you will need a local person to help with the payment, as online payment is not an option.I recommend [Zou Xiao](https://xiao-zou.com/) and his [guide](https://xiao-zou.com/prelude/)，, which is also recommended by most people online. After the payment is made, the embassy usually receives it the next day, and you can proceed with booking the appointment.

- ### Fingerprinting and visa interview.

  There are two things you need to do during the entire process: fingerprinting and the visa interview, both of which require appointments. For fingerprinting, just go at your scheduled time, and it will be done quickly. For the interview, it’s best to arrive early, even as early as 7:30 AM, since the embassy will let you in regardless of your appointment time. Unlike in China, the Mexico City embassy has seating inside, so even if you wait for two and a half hours, you can remain seated. Bringing a book would be a good idea.

  Visa Interview Process:

  1. First, wait in line. A staff member will check your information and mark "TCN" as yes or no on the barcode sticker on the back of your passport.
  2. As you move forward in line, you’ll encounter a queue system similar to those in tourist attractions, where a staff member will collect the passports of those marked with "TCN yes."
  3. You’ll do fingerprinting again. The staff handling fingerprints are usually very friendly, and they might even wish you luck with your visa.
     Security check.
  4. Continue forward, and a staff member will check your documents. Since you're marked as "TCN yes," you will be directed to different seating from the locals to wait. Shortly after, a staff member will call your name with your passport in hand, and you'll get your passport back at this point.
  5. The hardest part is now you can finally join the queue with the locals. However, regardless of which queue you're in, there are seats! Staff members will ask rows of people to stand and proceed to the interview, so you won’t need to stand in line the whole time!

  > [!IMPORTANT]
  > Last time I went around 8 a.m., and I still waited for over 2 hours. So, make sure to go early!

- ### Interview

  Many people likely have sensitive majors, and might require a security check that takes a month or even longer. In most cases, the interview officer will return your passport to you, allowing you to return to the U.S. under the [Auto Revalidation](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/visa-information-resources/visa-expiration-date/auto-revalidate.html) policy. Technically, this policy doesn’t apply since you’ve reapplied for a visa, but many people have successfully returned to the U.S. via land (air travel is not recommended), so I won’t elaborate on this here.

  Here are some tips for your reference:

## Recommended Apps

==Food Delivery==: **Uber Eats, Rappi, DiDi**. **Rappi** is likely the most commonly used, but everything is in Spanish, so you may need to take screenshots and have **ChatGPT** translate them for you. **Uber Eats** is relatively more user-friendly.

==Ridesharing==: **Uber, DiDi**. **DiDi** is often cheaper, and for longer trips, you can negotiate the price with the driver. **Uber** tends to be safer, but neither platform can fully guarantee your safety. Since you're already here, don't be too afraid.

## Accommodation Recommendations

I usually choose Airbnb near the embassy. The prices are relatively high but offer good value (definitely cheaper than hotels). The Airbnbs listed below are places I’ve stayed at — they’re safe and quiet. If you want something more upscale, you can stay at the Sheraton near the embassy. The embassy is right downstairs, and booking through Ctrip will likely be cheaper.

1. [Alejandra's listing](https://www.airbnb.cn/users/show/245618000)

   The listings from this host are generally good, with prices typically ranging from 300 to 450 RMB per day **(excluding cleaning fees and taxes)**.

   **Advantages**:

   - There is a dedicated team, and all listings are standardized.

   - You need a special access pass to enter, and the security guards will only let you in with it. It’s worth mentioning that the guards are diligent, professional, and very friendly.

   - There are outdoor security cameras, and the rooms have keypad locks.

   - Each unit is independent, equipped with a kitchen, utensils, and a bathroom. However, occasionally you might get unlucky with a slightly dirty pillow.

2. [Lilian's listing](https://www.airbnb.cn/rooms/30734316?adults=1&children=0&infants=0&pets=0&wishlist_item_id=11003788171356&check_in=2024-10-13&check_out=2024-10-16&source_impression_id=p3_1728586572_P3PeeMkXri7ewib_&previous_page_section_name=1000)

   I really don’t want to recommend her anymore; it’s becoming difficult for me to book her place. Her listings have already made it into the top 10% of properties.

   1. Around 220 RMB per day, and if you book for a week, it’s 180 RMB per day **(excluding cleaning fees and taxes).**
   2. Independent room with a private bathroom. The downside is that the router is in the living room, a bit far from the room, so video calls may occasionally lag.
   3. The host is very friendly and speaks English. They’ll enthusiastically introduce you to the local culture and recommend various great places. However, keep in mind that you’ll be living with the host, so if you’re socially anxious, take note of this.
   4. There’s also a security guard, and the property feels a bit like an apartment.

::: tip

Please note that if you order food delivery, you’ll definitely need to go downstairs to pick it up. For safety reasons, external personnel are not allowed inside.
