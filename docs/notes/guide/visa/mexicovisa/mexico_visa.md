::: tip

A Mexican tourist visa is relatively easy to obtain in the U.S., and it's generally faster than a Canadian visa. Note that if your U.S. visa is still valid, you can enter Mexico visa-free. This section only covers the process of applying for a Mexican visa when your U.S. visa has expired.

For detailed information, please refer to [Entering Mexico](../usvisa/mexico.md#entering-mexico)ã€‚
